## Stratum (electrum-server) Client Protocol library

Use python3 to be a client to the Electrum server network

You can probably find all you need already in the standard Electrum code and command line.

This is mean to be a mostly-clean room implementation, but isn't.



## Setup


    virtualenv -p python3 ENV
    (activate ENV)
